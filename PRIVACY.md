# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** November 2024

## Overview

Home Assistant MCP Server ("ha-mcp") runs entirely on your local machine and communicates only with your own Home Assistant instance. We are committed to transparency about any data collection.

## Data Collection

**Ha-mcp does not collect any data.** The server runs entirely locally on your machine and does not send telemetry, analytics, or any information to external servers.

**We do NOT collect:**
- Entity names or IDs
- Home Assistant configuration
- Personal information
- Automation or script content
- Any data from your smart home devices
- Usage statistics or analytics
- Error reports (unless you explicitly send them)

## Bug Reports

Ha-mcp may include a bug reporting feature that allows you to send diagnostic information when you encounter issues. Bug reports are:

- **Only sent with your explicit approval** — the AI assistant will ask before sending
- **Reviewed with you first** — you'll see what information is included
- **Anonymized** — personal data should be replaced with generic values before submission

You are always in control of whether to send a bug report.

## Your Home Assistant Data

When you use ha-mcp, Claude Desktop accesses data from your Home Assistant instance, including entity states, automations, and device information. This data:

- Is processed locally by Claude Desktop
- Is subject to [Anthropic's Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)
- Is NOT collected, stored, or transmitted by ha-mcp

## Third-Party Services

Ha-mcp communicates with:

- **Your Home Assistant instance** — via the URL and token you provide
- **Claude Desktop** — the MCP client that runs ha-mcp

Ha-mcp does not communicate with any other external services.

## Data Security

- Your Home Assistant credentials are stored locally by Claude Desktop
- Bug reports are only sent when you explicitly approve
- No data leaves your local network except to your Home Assistant instance

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes in our practices. Significant changes will be noted in release notes.
